    ."Make sure that you are on a healthy diet and that you are getting ample exercise. It will be beneficial to indulge in some stress-busting activities, be it reading a book or taking a walk, as stress can have an impact on your blood pressure. Speak to your doctor about how much weight is healthy to gain at different stages of pregnancy. Keeping a check on your weight is important as obesity is a major cause of hypertension. If you need to take medication, have a talk with your doctor about the safe medications to use as many blood pressure medications can be passed through the blood to your baby.

It is not just important for you, but for your baby, too. Take better care of your teeth by brushing them properly twice a day.

If you are still awake after twenty minutes, rather than eying the clock, get up and go into another room. Try reading or doing something else until you feel drowsy enough to give it another shot. Worrying about not sleeping will only make things worse for you. Exercising daily will be very helpful for you as it will help tire you out. Just make sure you do not exercise immediately before bed as this can actually keep you awake rather than help you fall asleep.
